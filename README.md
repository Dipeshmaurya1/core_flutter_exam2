# Project Description
- The Student Data Management Application is a comprehensive tool designed for educational institutions to efficiently manage student information. This application allows users to:

- Add New Student Data: Easily input new student details including Name, Grade, and Standard (Class). This ensures that all new admissions are promptly recorded and stored securely.

- Edit Existing Student Data: Update and modify student information as needed. This feature is particularly useful for correcting errors or updating details such as name changes or class promotions.

- Remove Student Data: Safely delete student records when they are no longer needed, such as when a student graduates or transfers to another school. This helps maintain an up-to-date and clutter-free database.
